        <b>School:</b> Algonquin Regional High School
        <br>
        <b>Timeframe: </b> September 2013 - May 2017
        <br>
        <b>Description:</b>
        I enjoyed my time at Algonquin because they allowed me to pursue something I really enjoyed. Algonquin
        offered a lot of different computer science classes and had their own department for it. Most of my friends in 
        college never had this unique oppurtunity Algonquin gave me. I took classes such as Python, C# and XNA, Visual
        Basic, C++ 1, C++ 2, HTML/CSS, and AP Computer Science. These classes inspired me and I took every one I could. 
        I was also I member of our programming club which competed in local programming competitions. 
        Our team placed first at Providence college in 2015.
