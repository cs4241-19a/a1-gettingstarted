    <h1>Information about Paris Lopez</h1>
    <p>
      Major: Computer Science <br /> 
      Minor: Psychology
    </p>
    <p>
      A senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Psychology. 
      I am looking forward to graduating a semester early in December 2019. After having attended a 
      myriad of courses involving the development of software and systems, I have come to realize 
      my enjoyment for Front-End Development. While comprehending the relationship between software 
      and hardware has value, understanding design and applying aesthetics to provide an overall 
      better experience to the user balances the necessities of the content and the requirements of presentation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to enjoying user interface design and development and dedicating myself to working on my degree, 
      I also commit a large amount of time to the Varsity Field Hockey team and have spent the past three years 
      playing lacrosse for the Women's Club Team. In my spare time, I read novels, specifically Stephen King, 
      and play video games such as The Sims 4 and 7 Days to Die.
