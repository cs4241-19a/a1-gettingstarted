    <p> <!-- Introduction -->
      Hey, my name is Alex! I'm 21 years old, and I'm from Dartmouth, MA. I prefer he/him pronouns.
    </p>
    <p> <!-- About me -->
      I'm a senior at WPI double majoring in Computer Science and Interactive Media and Game Development.
      I love to play video games, particularly RPGs (both single-player and multiplayer). <br> I'm currently playing
      Final Fantasy 14 (an MMO) to help me socialize with others in isolation, though weirdly enough DOOM Eternal's had me hooked
      me lately (I'm not usually into shooters).
    </p>
    <p>
      I love to travel, too! I've been to a lot of countries as a tourist. I also studied in Germany for one semester
      and spent one term in London to do my IQP. I was going to go to Japan for my MQP this term, but the pandemic
      cancelled it :( <br> Still, I'm excited that I get to take this class and gain valuable web development experience!
    </p>
