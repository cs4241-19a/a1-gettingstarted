      [Self Introduction]
      
      A senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Psychology. 
      I am looking forward to graduating a semester early in December 2019. After having attended a 
      myriad of courses involving the development of software and systems, I have come to realize 
      my enjoyment for Front-End Development. While comprehending the relationship between software 
      and hardware has value, understanding design and applying aesthetics to provide an overall 
      better experience to the user balances the necessities of the content and the requirements of presentation. 
      
      In addition to enjoying user interface design and development, I also commit a large amount of time 
      to the Varsity Field Hockey team and have spent the past three years playing lacrosse for the 
      Women's Club Team. In my spare time, I read novels, specifically Stephen King, and 
      
      
      My interest in the design of applications derives from 
      my desire to create, and I would like to continue studying the relationship between user and 
      experience as my career progresses. While this task may be achieved in various formats, 
      from gaming to data visualization, I would prefer to apply my knowledge in the science of 
      education or well-being. While continuously learning about the process of design and its relation 
      to the user, I can direct my education towards assisting others through technology.
