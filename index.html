      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Andrew Levy and I am currently a senior at WPI in the class of 2020!
        I enjoy programming and computers as well as designing and playing games. My goal is to become a web/full stack/software developer for my career and I hope that taking Webware 
        will give me the skills I need to succeed. On campus I am a member of the Beta Theta Pi 
        fraternity. We are represented by delicate shades of pink and blue (like the colors of this webpage). I also try to stay active 
        in intramural sports and I will be joining the ultimate frisbee league this year.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I am a computer science major with a minor in IMGD.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I have taken all of the intro CS classes as well as Software Engineering,
        Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Social Implicaions, Foundations of
        Computer Science, Operating Systems, and I am currently working on a software 
        engineering MQP.

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I have my own personal experience creating a website (<a href="http://www.andrew-levy.com" target="_blank">andrew-levy.com</a>). I took a little insipiration from some of the CSS on my
        website for this assignment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do not have any experience in the field with web development during an internship or job.
