    <h4>Computer Science Work Experience</h4>
      <button class="collapsible">+ MQP Prep 2019</button>
      <div class="content">
      <p>
        I worked mostly in the lab imaging moss with a silenced gene, but I also taught myself R and Matlab to complete some data and image analysis.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="collapsible">+ Monsanto 2018</button>
      <div class="content">
      <p>
        I worked mostly in the lab helping with a phage problem, but other than lab work, I was responsible for biulding two features for their employee website.
      <br> 
        Feature 1 was a search bar for their website (so they could easily find product codes). 
      <br> 
        Feature 2 was a 'recent links' section on each employee's home login page. 
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <button class="collapsible">+ iGEM 2017</button>
      <div class="content">
      <p>
        iGEM stands for international genetically engineered machine. It's an international biology competition for teams of college students.
        We did some cool biology things, but I also helped put a website together with my team.
