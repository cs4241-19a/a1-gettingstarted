    Hi I'm René Borner!
</h1>
<h2>Self introduction</h2>
<p>
    I'm an international exchange student from Germany and study at WPI for the 2019 A and B Term. I'm in the class of
    2023 but I obviously won't graduate at WPI.<br>
    In Germany I'm majoring in Business Information Technology at <a href="https://www.htwg-konstanz.de">HTWG Constance</a>.<br>
    After I finish my courses here at WPI successfully I only have to write my bachelor thesis to successfully
    conclude my study.
</p>
<h2>Major and other information</h2>
<p>
    My major at WPI is computer science. Because I'm an exchange student I have not taken any previous CS courses at
    WPI.<br>
    At my home university there are generally way more courses that you take during one semester, but some of the
    courses that I have taken are Intro to Programming, Fundamentals of Computer Systems, Algorithms and Data
    Structures, Operating Systems, Probability and Statistics, Database and Information Systems, Software Engineering
    and Computer Networks.
