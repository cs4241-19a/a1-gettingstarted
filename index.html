    <h1>Information about Michael Bosik</h1>
    <p>
      I am just starting my Junior year here at WPI. This past summer, I had an internhsip at a startup company<br/>
      called Tracelink in which I was able to program using React Javascript. This sparked my interest in learning<br/>
      how to create websites from scratch. As a side project, I developed my own personal website portfolio <strong><a href="http://michaelbosik.com" target="__blank">michaelbosik.com</a></strong><br/>
      to experiement with the different capabilities of web development tools such as bootstrap, sass and JQuery.<br/>
      I have really come to enjoy web development during this process and I would love to persue a career in the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in IMGD. I started as a double major in both fields,</br>
      however, I found the IMGD courses did not have as much programming as I had desired.
