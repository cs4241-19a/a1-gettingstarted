    <h1>About Katherine Thompson</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Katherine and I am a Computer Science major with a Business minor in the class of 2020.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      As I go into my senior year I have taken quite a few computer science courses at WPI.
      Some of my favorites include Software Engineering, Databases I and II, and Intro to AI.
      This year I am excited to take this class as well as Data Visualization and Data Mining.
      I am currently starting my MQP which includes web development and data visualization.
      I hope to learn skills in this class that will help me with this project.
