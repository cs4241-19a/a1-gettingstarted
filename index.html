    <p>
      As I go into my senior year I have taken quite a few computer science courses at WPI.
      Some of my favorites include Software Engineering, Databases I and II, and Intro to AI.
      This year I am excited to take this class as well as Data Visualization and Data Mining.
      I am currently starting my MQP which includes web development and data visualization.
      I hope to learn skills in this class that will help me with this project.
