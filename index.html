    <h1>Information about Andrew Hand, Computer Science WPI class of 2020.</h1>
    <p>
      As a computer scientist I hope to advance computing technologies to see a world dedicated to efficient and secure communication. To help, I plan to become a network security engineer. My interests include ethical hacking, database engineering, data visualization, and playing Destiny 2 when the terminal needs some time to do its thing.
