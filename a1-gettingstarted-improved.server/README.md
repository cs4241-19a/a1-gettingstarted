Assignment 1 - Hello World: Basic Deployment w/ Git, GitHub, Glitch
===

*DUE: Thursday, August 29th by 11:59 AM (before the start of class!)*  

This assignment is a "warm-up" exercise. 
You will simply deploy the starting Web site that you will use this term to [Glitch](http://www.glitch.com/). 

Treat this assignment as a chance to get up to speed on Git, GitHub, and Glitch. 
If you already know these, great. 
However, if you're new to them, spend several hours practicing, experimenting, and reading documentation. 
In other words, don't just get your website up and done. You will need skills with these tools throughout the rest of the course.

Assignment details
---

Do the following to complete this assignment:

1. Fork the starting project code in GitHub. This repo contains:
    * the server code, `server.js`
    * A starting `index.html` file that you will edit as described below
    * A package.json file that helps configure Glitch
    * This README
2. Edit `index.html` to show the following information about you:
    * your name and class at WPI (e.g. class of 2020) Note: Do not put any contact or personal information that you do not potentially want other people outside of this class to see.
    * your major(s) and minor(s)
    * previous computer science courses that you have taken at WPI
    * your experience with the following technologies and methods (none, some, a lot)
        * HTML
        * CSS
        * Java
        * JavaScript
        * Ruby
        * Python
        * unit testing
3. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page, it displays correctly. You can do this locally by simply running `node server.js` from within the assignment directory.

4. Modify the README file according to the specification below.
5. Commit and push all your changes to GitHub. 
6. Deploy your project to Glitch. You can do this by [importing the repo from GitHub](https://medium.com/glitch/import-code-from-anywhere-83fb60ea4875)
7. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme (guide follows) so we can find it.
8. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo.

Naming and URL Scheme
---

You must use a consistent naming scheme for all projects in this course.
If we can't find it, we can't grade it.

By default Glitch often assigns your application a random name. To change it, click on the project dropdown menu in the upper left corner of Glitch. You will then see an additional text field displaying the project name in the resulting menu; click here to edit the name.

The name scheme should be `a1-yourGitHubUsername`.
The `a1` will need to be updated to `a2`, `a3`, and so on in future projects.
