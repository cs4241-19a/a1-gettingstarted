This project shows my name, a basic description of what I do at WPI, info about by Degree, my CS background, and my work experience. The project employs basic HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Utilized HTML**: Using basic HTML, made a website that displays info about me, as well as links to an external website (YouTube).

### Design Achievements
- **Re-styled the page with CSS**: Using internal CSS (in a style tag), the Degree info and CS info were styled to include borders of different colors.
