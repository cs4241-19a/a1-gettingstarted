## Technical Achievements
- **Used express for server logic**: Based on some help from this stack overflow link: https://stackoverflow.com/a/28838314, this enabled me to easily use an external CSS file for styling. As we discussed in class, since the server code was given to us anyways it seems ok to swap it out for code that facilitates easy uploading of css files, etc.

### Design Achievements
- **Utilized a minimalist matrix-inspired design**: Shown in `home.css`, I made the background black and the text matrix-green, I also changed the font to a style that felt pleasant.

### Notes
I was having trouble getting Glitch to import my code from GitHub, so I used the VS Code Glitch extension to deploy this site to Glitch. The server code that is currently running on my Glitch page was generated by the VS Code extension.
