Note: I originally submitted a pull request to the 2019 repository. No changes to the code have been made since that original pull request. The only commit made since the assignment's due date was to update the README to include this message. Professor Roberts and both TA's were notified of this via Teams on 9/13.

## Technical Achievements
- **Added support for external CSS and JS**: Re-wrote server to serve any static file requested by a GET request and implemented error handling for 404 (file doesn't exist) and 405 (request method not allowed) errors.
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, h1, h2, p, a, img, li, table, th, and td selectors and multiple attribute id's using an external stylesheet and Bootstrap Grid.
- **Used additional HTML tags**: Included a link to my GitHub using an image of the GitHub logo and formatted my experience with technologies in a table.
- **Added a simple Javascript animation**: Added a background image formed by a linear gradient from 7 colors along a 180 degree angle. The angle is increased by 1 degree every frame at 60fps and resets to 0 degrees once it reaches 360 degrees.  

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Anton Font from Google Fonts**: Used Anton as the font for all text on the site.
