This assignment shows information about myself, including my year and major.

There are sections detailing the courses I have taken and currently taken, and also my prior experiences with technologies and work.

## Technical Achievements

- **Bootstrap library implementation**: I successfully imported the [Bootstrap library](https://getbootstrap.com/) and utilized various components (Containers, Columns, Cards, etc)
- **Created a customized scrollbar (Technical)**: I also created a customized scrollbar for this assignment, which required me research about [Webkit CSS extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/WebKit_Extensions).
I got inspiration as to how to create my own scrollbar from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_custom_scrollbar.asp)
- **Loading images**: I determined how to load images for this assignment.  One way is to use the image's CDN after uploading to the assets folder in glitch.
I created a separate images/assets folder to store my images so I can use a file path instead of a CDN (learned how to do it from [here](https://support.glitch.com/t/assets-folder-path/4638/7).
I also needed to modify the server.js file so that the server can properly read the image files.
- **Animated slideshow**: I wanted to include an animated slideshow of my summer travels at the end, so I researched how to do it and drew inspiration from [here](https://codepen.io/fcalderan/pen/jqpzd)

### Design Achievements
- **Overriding certain library features**: Although I used the Bootstrap library, I wanted my assignment to have a different background color and font than what the library used because I felt the library's backgrounds and fonts (which are sans serif fonts) did not reflect my personality and what I wanted to portray for my assignment.
I learned how to override default settings to set my background to pale pink and the font to the Georgia font from reviewing information from [here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/style-override-technique/)
- **Created a customized scrollbar (Design)**: To go with what I said earlier about how I created the customized scrollbar under technical achievements, I also wanted the scrollbar to be a part of the overall theme of my page, which was why I decided to design the scrollbar to match the page.
- **Organized course list**: I decided to portray my courses in columned lists instead of how the assignment had them by default as one long list.
Using the Bootstrap library, I organized my courses into three columns (first column for 1000 and 2000 level CS courses, second column for 3000 level, and third column for 4000 level) so the user can view this information easier.
