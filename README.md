This project shows 
1) I was able to fork the repo successfully. 
2) I changed the server.js file to load in the external style sheet I created
3) I modified the starting index html file to include the following:
	* your name and class at WPI
    	* your major
    	* No previous computer science courses that you have taken at WPI
    	* your experience with the following technologies and methods (none, some, a lot)
        	* HTML
        	* CSS
        	* Java
        	* JavaScript
        	* Ruby
        	* Python
        	* unit testing
4) I left the package json file alone because it was doing what it was supposed to do
5) I used the proper naming conventions for the project in Glitch and in Github

## Technical Achievements
1) I successfully changed the server.js file to handle an external style sheet
2) I successfully attached the external style sheet to the index.html file
3) I successfully used the style sheet inside the index.html file
4) I incorporated styles inline and from external sources
5) I used Glitch's asset system to get the exact URLs of the images on the page
rather than use relative addresses.
6) I used z-index to overlay items for layout purposes.

### Design Achievements
1) I used a variety of ways to absolutely position images and tables containing data to retain
a layout that was planned outside of an .html editor
2) I edited tags inside the external style sheet to better maintain a cohesive design. For instance,
the hyperlink tag is normal blue. This did not show up well on my page, so I changed it to ice or Alice blue.
3) I designed a dynamic layout that reflects my identity as an artist/game designer.
