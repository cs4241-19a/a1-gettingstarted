This project shows some of my current HTML, CSS, Javascript and Design skills.

## Technical Achievements
- I used Babylon.js to implement a custom 3D "grid heightmap" header background.
- I used jQuery.js and TypeIt.js to create a custom interactive experience in which the user
watches the site "build itself". I had to figure out how to combine jquery and typeit to create this experience 
without any additional resources, which includes chaining forced scrolling, animations, time delays, and DOM manipulation etc.
- I added audio play/pause functionality.

### Design Achievements
- No templates/external css files were used for this project (besides the default bootstrap css which I used to improve the site design).
- I designed the interactive experience from scratch, for example, I figured out the best timing, 
color scheme, animation speed, auto-scroll behavior.
- I implemented a minimalist greyscale design.
- I paid attention to minor details to improve interactivity, such as color changes on hover.
- The website is responsive and adapts to mobile version (through use of bootstrap).
- All the CSS is custom coded for this site, including a custom font from [dafont](https://www.dafont.com/).
- Added soft synthetic sound to further the user experience.
