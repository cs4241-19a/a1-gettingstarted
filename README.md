### This project shows
> 1. I was able to fork the repo successfully. 

> 2. I changed the server.js file to load in the external style sheet I created.  
>>> *I first attempted to do this by reading in the style sheet file and allowing for it in the switch statement. I eventually got Charlie's server running on my machine.*

> 3. I modified the starting index html file to include the following:
>> - my name and class at WPI
>> - my major
>> - I did not list any other CS courses from WPI because this is my first.
> 4. My experience with the following technologies and methods (none, some, a lot)
>> - HTML
>> - CSS
>> - Java
>> - JavaScript
>> - Ruby
>> - Python
>> - unit testing  

> 5. I left the package json file alone because it was doing what it was supposed to do
> 6. I used the proper naming conventions for the project in Glitch and in Github

### Technical Achievements
> I successfully changed the server.js file to handle an external style sheet prior to Monday's class.  

> I successfully attached the external style sheet to the index.html file.  

> I successfully used the style sheet inside the index.html file.   

> I incorporated id names for the image absolute image positions *(A choice I made to match my actual CV)*. 

> I incorporated class names for text sections to show fluency with .css

> I used Glitch's asset system to get the exact URLs of the images on the page rather than use relative addresses.

> I used z-index to overlay items for layout purposes.

> I figured out how to format my markdown page to make it look nice.

### Design Achievements
> I used a variety of ways to absolutely position images and tables containing data to retain a layout that was planned outside of an .html editor.   

> I edited tags inside the external style sheet to better maintain a cohesive design. *(For instance, the hyperlink tag is normal blue. This did not show up well on my page, so I changed it to ice or Alice blue.)*.   

> I designed a dynamic layout that reflects my identity as an artist/game designer.
