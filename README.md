This project is my submission for Assignment 1 of Webware, which contains a bit about me and my experience.

Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for h1, h2, body, main, and li > ul > li. h1 is a different color, font, and is bold, h2 is a different color and italics, body is a different color with padding, main is a different color, and li > ul > li makes sub-bullets a smaller font size.

- **Add a simple JavaScript animation to the page**: Added a button that moves a circle left and right.

- **Experiment with other HTML tags**: (5 total) Added img for an image (color wheel), button for the animation, br for line spacing, svg > circle for the animation, and main for the website box.
  
- **Modified server.js to include more files**: Added additional files to the server, specifically the image used, javascript file, and css file. This was a simple tweak, but this is my first time messing around with javascript servers.

Design Achievements

- **Create a color palette using color.adobe.com.**: Self explanatory, but the color wheel is also part of the website.

- **Used the Cousine Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for the header of my website.
