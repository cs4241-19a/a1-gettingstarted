This project shows my self introduction, major information, previous
computer science classes, and familiarity with certain technologies. This
is portrayed in a collapsible format (& uses my favorite color!). Each of
components shows the information for each topic when clicked on. The code
to implement these components was found from the w3schools.com website.
(I am citing here, and used comments in my code, that the code to write
these components was found from:

## Technical Achievements
- None Implemented

### Design Achievements
- **Implemented collapsible component**: Using code found in link above, 
I was able to understand how to implement and edit a collapsible component for my 
webpage. I edited the first two sections which style and create the componenet, 
allowing a hover and content section. The third section, which implemented 
the action listener and allowed the collapsible action, remained untouched
as no changes were needed for the action to occur.
