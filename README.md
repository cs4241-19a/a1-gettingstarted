This project incldues some basic information about myself.

Technical Achievements:
This project is my first webpage I have created. I played around with making different lists by using ul and li. 

Design Achievements:
I used the site https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/011/firstcss.en.html to make some changes to the style of the page and this can be seen in the index.html file. I changed the background and font colors, as well as the fonts for the text on the webpage. 
I tried to create a style.css file as you can see in the submission, however I was unable to make the changes apply to the webpage from the style.css file. I read about how to implement css files from this website: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp.
