This project shows personal information about me, as well as some of my basic knowledge in html, javascript, and css already, while also adding a few more things that I have not used before. I have fulfilled the basic requirements of the project in forking the project, listing the required information about myself in the project, and hosting it on glitch at the above link. The work that went into each of the technical and design achievements are stated in detail below.


## Technical Achievements
This achievement is largely based on my prior knowledge about javascript:
- Added an onclick event listener to the page's background with prompts to reload the page, and if not reloaded, to change the page's background color. This event listener is also usable on the alternative.html page included.

The following achievements are relatively new to me:
- Used JQuery to add a mouseover event to the list of my experience with technologies and methods, to show my experience with each item in the list.
- Created and added a favicon.ico image.

### Design Achievements
This achievement is largely based on my prior knowledge about css:
- Added css for background and text coloring.

The following achievements are relatively new to me:
- Added a text animation upon loading and reloading index.html, largely based on the MDN example at the link in the css file.
- Imported alternative fonts for use in the document from google fonts, (Cabin and Lexend Giga), and applied them to index.html.
