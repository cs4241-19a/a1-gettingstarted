Assignment 1 - Hello World: Basic Deployment w/ Git, GitHub, Glitch
===

Glitch Project: [https://a1-tmwbook.glitch.me/](https://a1-tmwbook.glitch.me/)

## Technical Achievement
In this project I chose to incorporate Bootstrap 4.3 to make the website responsive on all screen sizes!


## Design Achievement
I used the new horizontal card feature in Bootstrap for my quick bio as well as my job experience.
I think this calls attention to the content well and guides the eye naturally to the subject the website is about.
I also used a color coding scheme for my level of proficiency with web technology.
Last is the overall color scheme of the website. While I was thinking about the design I was setting up my new computer, as such I needed to download git.
I really liked the theme of the website and the solorized-like theme to base my website off of.
