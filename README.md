## Technical Achievements
- **Name display**: I use multiple names, so it was important to display them as they reflect who I am and my interests by writing some javascript code to iterate through them.
- **No third party libraries for the website**: I wanted to take the chance to learn how to do things myself rather than relying on a CSS framework as usual. I utilized flex box, media queries, and other CSS attributes to create the site.
- **Tab color** If viewing this on mobile or on a desktop browser like Vivaldi, then you will see the custom tab color on the website.
- **Favicon** You will see my personal favicon loading on the site.

### Design Achievements
- **Minimal dependencies**: The site was designed to be simple yet aesthetically pleasing. It still feels interactive due to the transitions and dynamic name display.
- **Mobile friendly**: The site was designed to look good whether on a phone or desktop.
