This project shows my work for the first assignment of Webware.
It contains some basic information about who I am and what I do at WPI. 

The site is divided into 
- Home
- About
- Education
- Courses
- Skills
- Experience
- Contact

To make this site, I used mostly HTML and CSS. Below is a more concrete list of the technical and design choices I made. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Overlay of sections**: Used CSS to place the divs strategically throughout the site to create the illusion of two layers in the site
- **Navigation pane**: Used <nav> and <a> tags to create a navigation pane for the site that links to various parts
- **Hover to change text effect**: Used CSS and JS to trigger the text on the course tiles to move up to reveal the name of the class. Also added another box inside the tile on hover. Can see on cards.css
- **Expanding content boxes for work experience section**: Used CSS to create boxes that when clicked expand to show more information on my work experiences
- **Customized text**Custom font color, letter spacing, and font weight for different parts of the site
- **Optimized to look great on screens of all sizes**: Font and object size is controlled by the size of the screen, and it refreshes every time the screen size changes regardless of whether the page was previously loaded or not. 
- **Used Flexboxes**: Added flexboxes as a way to more easily control layout of different boxes in site

### Design Achievements
- **Parallax-style site**: The static background while text is being srolled up creates a depth effect similar to parallax style websites
- **Effect of showing more text on hover**: Done for the courses aspect of my website to encourage interactivity with the user. 
- **Added animation on scroll**: Used the aos API to add fade in animations to text and images
- **Decreased opacity of education boxes**: Used CSS to decrease opacity of background to add variety to the site
- **Custom color, letter spacing, alignment of text**: Used CSS to change aspects of text to best fit their purpose and be aesthetically pleasing
- **About me box between two background images**: Chose to do so to create a connection between the homepage and the rest of the site, to prompt user to scroll down and see what's after
- **Fade to blue for homepage background**: Used Photoshop to create a gradient on the image in order to fit the theme of the site better
- **Used tables to represent my CS skills**: Shown in `style.css`, I used a table with icons from FontAwesome to show a skills matrix of the required skills
- **Formatted table for better graphical experience**: Again using CSS, I only showed the left border of every column, and removed all other borders, as well as used various centering to make the table as easy to understand and pleasing to the eye as possible. 
- **Icons connected to external links for contact**
- **Shadows** behind almost every big element on the site: Done in order to create depth and separate front layers from the background image. 
- **Bold names on hover for navbar elements**: Used CSS to give the user a sense of where they are located and the feeling of having a clickable object
- **Optimized to look great on screens of all sizes**: Font and object size is controlled by the size of the screen, and it refreshes every time the screen size changes regardless of whether the page was previously loaded or not.
