This project shows imformation about my work experience and technical skills.

## Technical Achievements
- **Upgraded server.js**: I edited server.js to also serve my styles.css file before Professor Roberts showed his improved server in class.

### Design Achievements
- **Added CSS file**: I added a styles.css file to change the user interface. Kept the UI simple to show basic understanding of 
different css design elements. For example, I chnaged the background color, made the header stand out more, and seperated the 
different types of experiences to make the information more visually appealing.
