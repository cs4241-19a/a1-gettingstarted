This site displays some information about me and my experience as a CS student.

## Technical Achievements
- **Used FontAwesome**: I imported FontAwesome and used their icons as bullets in my ul elements.
- **Upgraded server.js**: I edited `server.js` to include accurate status codes and to also serve my css file (`style.css`), a background image, and also a favicon.

### Design Achievements
- **Used custom bullets**: I used FontAwesome icons to convey meaning with bullets. Bullets distinguished between completed and current classes.
- **Added Background**: I added a background image and solid background with minor opacity.
