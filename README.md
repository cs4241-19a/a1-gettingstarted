This project shows some basic information about myself as a student at WPI.

## Technical Achievements
- **Added another html file**: Used two seperate html files in order to display the information in a more concise format. The second file is called `experience.html`
- **Created hover buttons**: Made two buttons that allows users to switch between the main home page and the exerience page. These buttons also become filled in when hovered over which increases usability. This code can be found in `styles.css`
- **Added hover picture**: Inserted a resume style picture of myself to add context. When the user hovers over the picture, they can see my contact information. (This is only my wpi email for privacy reasons) This code can be found in `image_styles.css`

### Design Achievements
- **Image Header**: I used an image as the header for the website. This creates a more modern look as similar designs are seen in many other websites. This can be found in `styles.css`
- **Color Scheme**: I picked specific colors from the header image and used them thrughout the site, notable the grey on the sides and the orange for the image hover, the buttons, and the footer. This helped to create a more cohesive design. This can be found in `styles.css`
- **Layout**: I used a specific layout that included a header, footer, navigation bar, main column, and a side bar. This involved changing the sizing and padding of each elements accordingly when I wanted to change the size. The purpose of this layout is to provide information to a user in an effienct and expected way (the title in the header at the top, the main information to the left, supplementary information on the right hand side, basic context in the footer, and navigation towards the top). This can be seen in `styles.css`

### Note
- There is duplicate code between index.html and experience.html. I intended to create components like in Angular for the information sections and keep the headers and footers constant. However I was unable to achieve this wil only using html.
