### Design Achievements
In addition to the content describing information about myself as well as some examples of my past projects,
this webpage shows an implementation of both style through the 'styles.css' and interactivity through 'app.js'. 
In styles.css the code formats each element according to their class name. Overall the body of the page is colored 
different shades of blue and the font style is Arial or TW Cen MT Condensed sans-serif fonts. It also separates 
the content of the html page into a sidebar and the page itself. The sidebar is fixed so the user can always easily 
access it, while the body of the page is scrollable. In app.js there are two different function that allow the user 
to hover over the tabs in the sidebar to change each one's color. When clicked, these tabs scroll to the appropriate
title in the body of the page.
