### This project shows
 1. I was able to fork the repo successfully. 

 2. I changed the server.js file to load in the external style sheet I created.  
>> *I first attempted to do this by reading in the style sheet file and allowing for it in the switch statement. I eventually got Charlie's server running on my machine.*

 3. I modified the starting index html file to include the following:
> - my name and class at WPI
> - my major
> - I did not list any other CS courses from WPI because this is my first.
 4. My experience with the following technologies and methods (none, some, a lot)
> - HTML
> - CSS
> - Java
> - JavaScript
> - Ruby
> - Python
> - unit testing  

 5. I left the package json file alone because it was doing what it was supposed to do
 6. I used the proper naming conventions for the project in Glitch and in Github

### Technical Achievements
 I successfully changed the server.js file to handle an external style sheet prior to Monday's class.  

 I successfully attached the external style sheet to the index.html file.  

 I successfully used the style sheet inside the index.html file.   

 I incorporated id names for the image absolute image positions *(A choice I made to match my actual CV)*. 

 I incorporated class names for text sections to show fluency with .css

 I used Glitch's asset system to get the exact URLs of the images on the page rather than use relative addresses.

 I used z-index to overlay items for layout purposes.

 I figured out how to format my markdown page to make it look nice.

### Design Achievements
 I used a variety of ways to absolutely position images and tables containing data to retain a layout that was planned outside of an .html editor.   

 I edited tags inside the external style sheet to better maintain a cohesive design. *(For instance, the hyperlink tag is normal blue. This did not show up well on my page, so I changed it to ice or Alice blue.)*.   

 I designed a dynamic layout that reflects my identity as an artist/game designer.
