This project shows a webpage displaying my personal information such as my major and experiences. 
It also describes my knowledge of certain technologies and methods as well as what CS courses I have
taken in the past. The webpage has a table, using animations, and has a custom font applied to the text.

## Technical Achievements
- **Added a Google custom Font to the text**: Applied a custom font through CSS and HTML. This font is more
attractive and easier to read than the original font.

- **Added comments to Index.html**: If you count the comments within the index.html as a technical achievement. It shows that
I understood what exactly does what.

### Design Achievements
- **Organized experiences into a table**: The webpage displays a table through the use of CSS code which 
can be seen in the index.html. I added the table to organize and neaten up the technologies and methods together 
which makes it easier to read.

- **Animated Headings and table**: The table and headings on each of the sections were animated through the
use of the Animate.css library. The headings remain animated after the initial entrance animation occurs.
I accessed the library through a link shown within the beginning of the index.html file. The animations
give the webpage a "WOW" effect or catches the interest of the user. It makes it seem like a fun webpage.
 
- **Background Gradient color**: I gave the webpage a background color gradient using CSS. The background
gives the webpage a dusk effect. Also my favorite color is orange and if I made the background just orange,
it would seem too aggressive and hard to read the text. In this way, the gradient gives an attractive background while 
also making it easy to read the text.
