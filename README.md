This project shows a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technical Achievements
- **Modified Server**: 
Modified `server.js` to pass local files to the front-end before professor Roberts posted the new `server.js`.
Below is a link of a commit I made as a proof.

- **Embedded Links**: Embedded links of some of my projects using buttons.
- **Slide Show**: Implemented a slide show feature in `script.js` that shows fun facts about me in slides.

### Design Achievements
- **Basic Styling**: Shown in `style.css`, I added a background image and font change.
- **Sweet Alert**: Shown in `index.html`, I added a sweet alert that displays a welcome message using script.
- **Alignment**: I divided the page into 2 sections since I wanted to show more about myself.
- **Decorations**: I decorated the left side by having a picture and coloring the key words.
