This project shows the basic deployment of a web application using Git, GitHub and Glitch. I modified code to input information about myself to a websit using html.
I have also added a .css file to the project to add some color to the webpage. This was a good refresher on how to use github to fork the assignment and to create a pull request.


Technical Achievements

Added .css file: I added a .css file to the project to add some color to the website. I created a separate .css file called style.css to modify the background, font, and font color of the website.
I linked the .css file to the index.html file to have the changes be applied to the website. I followed this tutorial online to help me understand the basics of css: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J35jug1uHzE


Design Achievements

Added color to the website: I added a color scheme to the website to make it look more appealing to the eye compared to the standard black and white website.
I used this website to help find a good color combination: https://www.viget.com/articles/color-contrast/
