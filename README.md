This project shows that I can make a basic website with html and css, while using git and github.

## Technical Achievements
- **Extra Reference links:**: Added a photo including a reference link to my instagram that will open in a new tab.
- **Typewriter:**: Using css and encorporating it into my html file, my header will show a typewriter effect anytime you refresh.

### Design Achievements
- **CSS Stylesheet:** Shown in `style.css`, I added background and text color, different alignment, and modified the basic list structure. I also added the typewriter effect.
This was modified to fit my needs based on the examples found at (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/typewriter-effect/).
