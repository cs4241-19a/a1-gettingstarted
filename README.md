This project shows how a small personal website can be made with exclusively CSS and HTML. I intended to implement a dark mode feature using JavaScript to change the style of each element but ended up running out of time.

## Technical Achievements
- **Implemented Serving Other Files Early**: Implemented the functionality
of serving up custom CSS and image files before subsequent updates from server.js.
This can be seen from the commit history of the project, as the latest server
from Monday has been inserted here because of Mimetype support. 
- **Custom CSS Stylesheet from Scratch**: Implemented a custom CSS style from scratch without using
a template. Most of the CSS file has been written from scratch but I ended up 
using a guide from W3Schools to learn how to do a two-column layout using
CSS Flexbox which can be found here: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_two_columns.asp.
Also, this project was the first time I used CSS to write a custom stylesheet.
- **Custom Fonts from Google Fonts**: Learned how to import fonts using the Google
Fonts website to enable a more visually appealing website using the Open Sans, Roboto, and 
DM Serif Text fonts, as opposed to using any of the built-in fonts.

## Design Achievements
- **Material Design Inspired layout**: Shown in `style.css`, the website takes a card-based
design inspired by Google's Material Design that incorporates both image and text cards, using a two-column
layout to seperate text and images. Each subheader also has its own card to seperate sections of the website.
