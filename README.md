This project shows my progression in getting up to speed and prepared for the rest of the course in html, css, and javscript.
Using what we learned in class, I ran a node server that automatically refreshes and checks for an index.html file and a stylesheet.
I familiarized myself with the Glitch IDE by deploying my project there and updating my project side by side next to my code to
see it updating automatically. I changed the html to have a description of myself and my experience and added css to make the project
unique, interesting, and having meaning to me.

### Technical Achievements
- **set up a node server.js**: added code that creates server, updates automatically, and checks for certain files (or returns an error)
- **added a stylesheet**: created style.css file that modifies the index.html 
- **modified package.json, index.html**: replaced already written text in files with information about myself. Added mime dependancy.

### Design Achievements
- **beta theta pi theme**: Shown in 'style.css', the color theme is delicate shades of pink and blue represennting the colors of the fraternity. 
Also the css includes a box with borders, a linear gradient, and other various changes.
- **html headings/lists**: Shown in 'index.html', the webpage is formatted to have multiple types of headings as well as a list with bullet points removed.
There is a link to my website shown in index.html as well.
