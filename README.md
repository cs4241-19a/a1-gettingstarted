## Technical Achievements
- **Added support for external CSS and JS**: Re-wrote server to serve any static file requested by a GET request and implemented error handling for 404 (file doesn't exist) and 405 (request method not allowed) errors.
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, h1, h2, p, a, img, li, table, th, and td selectors and multiple attribute id's using an external stylesheet and Bootstrap Grid.
- **Used additional HTML tags**: Included a link to my GitHub using an image of the GitHub logo and formatted my experience with technologies in a table.
- **Added a simple Javascript animation**: Added a background image formed by a linear gradient from 7 colors along a 180 degree angle. The angle is increased by 1 degree every frame at 60fps and resets to 0 degrees once it reaches 360 degrees.  

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Anton Font from Google Fonts**: Used Anton as the font for all text on the site.
