For some reason, Glitch doesn't want to use my latest code and keeps rewinding back to the original template. I made sure I imported from Github correctly because my README can be found on glitch. All other files are fine on Glitch except my CSS styling sheets. My CSS files kept getting replaced by the original CSS files that came with the template although I did not do anything to glitch. Also Glitch is supposed to auto-save but it does not want to save the changes even if I tried pasting my styling sheets manually in there. I don't think there is anything wrong with my code because it can be opend up fine on 
1) my localhost 
2) directly opened as a HTML file 
3) with Webstorm. 




__Design Achievement__:
- Self-picked every single color used in this project and made up an overall cohesive color palette
- Modified an animated staggering bar chart using another color scheme (original here: https://codepen.io/vajkri/pen/NxzZwL)
- Most elements are animated while the original template is pretty much static (the original template can be found here for comparison: https://startbootstrap.com/previews/resume/)


__Technical Achievement__:
- Learned how to use multiple JQuery/JS/Angular/CSS libraries including: 
  - animate on scroll
  - scroll reveal
  - animate.css
  - particles.js
  - typeit.js 
    Particularly, learned how to use particle.js as background but only for the main page and modified the options. 
- Currently working on inserting a sticky section title with Waypoint but got stuck and could not figure out why... 
- animated widget box of coursework
- Fixed bugs with the original template where the email hyperlink malfunctions if the previous textbox inline is not long enough
