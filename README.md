I originally submitted my pull request to the 2019 repository, and only realized this once Professor Roberts sent out a message regarding that problem

### Technical Achievements

- **Styled Page with CSS:** Added rules for the body, h1, h2, p, li, table, th, and td as well as the job tag, the rules I used changed the font-family, padding, background-color, margin, display, font-weight, border, border-collapse, and text-align
- **Used Other HTML Tags:** Used the link, table, tr, th, td, a, and b tags as well as adding a custom tag job, one link is for adding the stylesheet, and the other is to make the Lato font available in the stylesheet

### Design Achievements

- **Used the Lato Font from Google Fonts:** Added the link to the index.html to allow the use of the Lato font-family in the stylesheet
- **Used a color palette from color.adobe.com:** Used the color palette on color.adobe.com which can be seen in the Color Palette.png file in the repository
