  - select: To create a small drop-down menu in the "Memes" section at the bottom. Currently does nothing.
  - (The <iframe> tag was copied from YouTube's video embed, so it's not my work. I just put the video embed there for fun.)
- **Edited server.js**: Added cases to the switch statement inside http.createServer in order to add support for my external image and .css files.

### Design Achievements
- **Used a custom color palette from color.adobe.com**: You can find the color palette [here](https://github.com/alexmhunt/a1-gettingstarted/blob/master/colorpalette.png) in the repo. I used CSS styles to add these colors to the page using the h1, h2, h3, body, and li selectors.
