This project shows my basic understanding of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. Using the 3 languages, I created a simple webpage which contains information about my courses at WPI, my experience with different coding languages/methods, and my work experience. Listed below are my technical and design achievements for this project. 

## Technical Achievements
1. **Styled the page using CSS**
  - Added style to h1. Set its color to be dimgrey, set its font family to Bebas Neue (A Google font), and set its font size to be 70px.
  - Added style to the ul. For styling purposes I added a box around it with a background of powder blue. Also added a padding of 50px to the list. Lastly, assigned it to be in the Assistant font family (A Google font).
  - Added style to h2. Set the border to be solid 2px and powderblue in color. Set its font family to be Bebas Neue (A Google font).
  - Added style to table, th, and td. Set the border to be solid 2px and black in color. Set its font family to be Assistant (A Google font).
  - Set the header to be displayed as a block.
  - Set the font family of p to Assistant (A Google font).
2. **Added a simple JavaScript animation**
  - With the help of the tutorials on W3Schools, I was able to create a simple JavaScript for my heading where individual letters get placed in order. The code is placed under the "script" tag in the index.html file.
  - The function is given a string and it outputs them as the heading by placing the characters 1 by 1 and gives a typing effect
3. **Experiment with HTML Tags**
  - Used the link tag in HTML to link my LinkedIn Profile to my name on the Webpage
  - Used the table tag for my experience with different coding languages and methods
  - Used the list tag to create a list of my courses and my work experience
  - Used the Header tag for the heading of my website
  - Used the picture tag to specify image resources on the webpage
  - Used the image tag to add images to the webpage
