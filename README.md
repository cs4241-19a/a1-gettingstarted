This project allowed me to use the raw power of HTML, CSS, and JS to create a piece of art to myself and show not only my favorite classes and work experience, but that I am an expert at making images of wrestlers spin. You may ask yourself what influenced the expert level design of this website perhaps Van Gogh or maybe Picasso. NO! I did what gave me the most points.

## Technical Achievements

-   **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for h1, h2, h3, h4, body, and img.
-   **Experimented with HTML tags**: Used the h3, h4, a, img, and center tags.
-   **Added hyperlinked spinning images**: Implemented spinning images that link some of the best moments of Macho Man Randy Savage and Hulk Hogan.

## Design Achievements

-   **Used color.adobe.com to pick a color palette**: I use this color palette to add some life to my website. All five of the colors can be found on the website and an image of the color palette can be found in the file color.png.
-   **Used the Architects Daughter from Google Fonts**: I decided to use the wonderful Architects Daughter font for my website.
