This project shows how a small personal website can be made with exclusively CSS and HTML. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Implemented Serving Other Files Early**: Implemented the functionality
of serving up custom CSS and image files (and favicons) before subsequent updates from `server.js`.
This can be seen from the commit history of the project, as the latest server
from Monday has been inserted here because of Mimetype support. 
- **Custom CSS Stylesheet from Scratch**: Implemented a custom CSS style from scratch without using
a template, as this is the first time I have used CSS. As such, I had to do additional research to understand the
langage and know its capabilities from both MDN and W3Schools. For instance, I ended up using guides from W3Schools 
to learn how to do a two-column layout using Flexbox which can be found here: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_two_columns.asp and to look up common properties to apply to images https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_images.asp.
- **Custom Fonts from Google Fonts**: Learned how to import fonts using the Google
Fonts website to enable a more visually appealing website using the Open Sans, Roboto, and 
DM Serif Text fonts, as opposed to using any of the built-in fonts. Here is the link to the Google
Fonts site https://fonts.google.com/.

## Design Achievements
- **Material Design Inspired layout**: Shown in `style.css`, the website takes a card-based
design inspired by Google's Material Design that incorporates both image and text cards, using a two-column
layout to seperate text and images. Each subheader also has its own card to seperate sections of the website.
