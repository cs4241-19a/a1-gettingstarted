This project shows the use of HTML and CSS to create a webpage to display information to a user. 
It also needed a manipulation of the server code in order to utilize a CSS file.
I have had very limited experience in HTML and CSS in the past (CS3733: Software Engineering being the extent), 
so diving back into the languages gave me some new interesting skills and ideas for the ways the code could be extended and improved.

### Technical Achievements
- Added a :hover to the table rows and list components to help them stand out when being hovered over

### Design Achievements
- Used a CSS file to format the page beyond a base HTML page
- Imported a picture to give a sense of myself beyond the base description
