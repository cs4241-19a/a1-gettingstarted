Assignment 1 - Hello World: Basic Deployment w/ Git, GitHub, Glitch
===
This project shows that I can work with HTML, some CSS, and some JavaScript. There is a main page with information about me, including two 
pictures, one of my cat Thunder Paws, and one of me. The HTML includes classes and div's used in the CSS. There are also drop down tabs included
to see more detailed information about the titled subject. The drop down tabs were adapted from W3 schools, the one piece of them that was not 
modified was the JavaScript for making the buttons react when clicked. I was able to understand what was happening in this code, but I did not 
feel comfortable enough with JS to make changes. CSS was implemented to try to make the page a little more fun. I found and picked out the colors,
fonts, and features. I also added a case to the server so that the stylesheet could be loaded from it. 

## Technical Achievements
  - Added a case to the server to load the CSS stylesheet so it could be implemented in the webpage. It is a technical achievement because I modified the 
    general server provided.

  - Added a clickable JS drop-down feature. The code was mostly from w3 schools, but I was able to find the code for a feature that I wanted to implement, 
    but wasn't sure where to start. I also made sure I could understand what was happening in the code before adding it to my website. 
  
### Design Achievements
  - CSS Stylesheet: This sheet includes fonts, colors, and features that I picked out. I wrote most of it myself. The exception being that the
    section for the drop-downs started as being from w3 schools (because the classes are named in the same way), but I modified most of the 
    information within the CSS (like colors, and font attributes). 
  
  - Images: I was able to add two images to my page by using the assets section of glitch, and with an HTML <img> tag.
  
  - Lists: I used lists for most of the information within the drop-downs.
