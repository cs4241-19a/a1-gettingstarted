This project shows a website containing basic information about myself. The project demonstrates my ability to use Git, GitHub, and Glitch. In addition, it demonstrates my design skills through the use of HTML and CSS skills.

## Technical Achievements
- **Linked Pictures and CSS Stylesheet**: Based on the diagram posted in Slack, I was able to figure out how to add `style.css` in `index.html` and `server.js`. Initially, I thought you only had to link css files in the html doc and everything would just work out, but I quickly realized in class servers need their own code to load. Because of my discovery, I also experimented with adding pictures such as `bg.jpg` and `profilepic.png` to `server.js`, and to my suprise, they all loaded.

### Design Achievements
- **New Layout and Font**: After I wrote in all my information in `index.html`, I realized that the site didn't have a certain aesthetic appeal that would represent me. So I decided to upload my own background art with neutral colors and "professional" profile picture to add color and personality. In addition, I aligned everything in the center to be read from top to bottom for ease of reading. I also changed the font to Arial since it seemed to work better with a modern flat background.
- **Column Layout**: As seen in `style.css`, I created a column structure for my educationa and experience sections. I actually tried 2 methods that I kept flipping between. One used the coulmn functions, and the second was a manipulation of blocks with varying widths. After an hour of playing around with the formatting and realizing I really wanted a clean line in the middle of my column structure, I decided to use the first method. However, I realized I wanted to push my experience work in the second column. As a result, I used a `break-inside` shown in `style.css` to force my experience to the 2nd column. 
- **Pop Up**: When I saw my profile pic, I thought it could use something extra, so I added a href link to a larger picture of my face. Since that appeared to be rather creepy, I ditched that and added a pop up message to be a fun way to greet the user if they so happen to click on my face. To make it, I created the pieces and wrote a small script in `index.html` that showed/hid the popup.
