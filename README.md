This project serves as a basis for a personal website with content related to my CS course history at WPI, relevant work experience and expertise with particular technologies.

## Technical Achievements
- **Added the Bootstrap library**: Equipped the webpage with a Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/) themed UI. In `index.html` I incorporated the Bootstrap CSS libraries and associated Javascript and JQuery into the project. 
- **Responsive text panel**: I implemented a collapseable text panel utilizing pre-built Javascript and CSS from W3 Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_collapsible). I corrected the spacing of this section and customized the colors of both the panel and text.
- **Implemented the improved server**: This project features the improved server and MIME library to server various file types and also hot reload the server to display current front-end changes.

### Design Achievements
- **Basic Style Enhancements**: I improved the barebone UI by incorparated basic Bootstrap themeing. I added a sticky-top navbar to display my name and WPI logo at a fixed location while manually scrolling. I aimed to utilize a more minimal UI with significant white space to draw the user's attention towards the central content. The informational cards possess a drop-shadow in order to illuminate their importance and attract visual attention. The cards are aligned in a row in order to effectively occupy horizontal space, which allows the user to consume information without unneeded scrolling or other action.

- **Assets**: The images on the site help to interupt the abundance of text on the screen. They provide an aesthetic appeal and add a mode of connection to the user. This contributes to the overall goal of delivering my personal story.
- **Collapsible text panel**: The site also features a collapsible text panel containing a personal description. This allows the user to toggle the visibility of this section depending on current action and preference. While hidden, more space is occupied on the UI with information that the user desires.
