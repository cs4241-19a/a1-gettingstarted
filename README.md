# Assignment 1 - Hello World: Basic Deployment w/ Git, GitHub, Glitch


## Description

Connor Burri:
<a href="https://a1-cjburri.glitch.me/">Glitch Site</a>

This project is a warmup exercise for CS4241 (Webware) that is meant as a introduction for deploying a website that will be used for the term on <a href="https://www.glitch.com">Glitch</a>.

The goal of this project was to get more acclimated to Git, Github and Glitch for source code management and deployment. As well as getting familiar with HTML, CSS and JS for the actual source code itself. By the end of this project, we should start to become familiar with the full web tech-stack (which I have successfully done).

The project itself was a single page website that was meant to be an introduction to ourselves, specifically citing:

<ol>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Class</li>
  <li>Majors and Minors</li>
  <li>Previous Courses</li>
  <li>And experiences in certain technologies</li>
</ol>

## Achievements

### Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS (5pts; 1 per element)**:
    - Background-color - I used this a handful of times to make the background of my Divs match the pallete I had
    - Border-radius - The way that I made the image of myself a circle was achieved with this
    - Text-justify - The justified margins of the description text was made with this css
    - Font-family - This is how I got the text to be 'Source Sans Pro' (backup is sans serif if it cannot load)
    - Color - This was used for changing the color of text between sections
    - **It is worth mentioning that most of the styling of this site was done through the library Bootstrap and I don't take credit for all of that styling; however, the above styling was done by myself with inline styling and some in another CSS file**
- **Experimented with HTML tags (5pts; 1 per element)**
    - Nav - Used for the navbar at the top of the page, the styling was done using Bootstrap, a CSS library
    - Div - This was mainly used for hierarchy of the page, I used the column/row feature a lot (provided by Bootstrap)
    - Span - This was used for the badges at the bottom of the page that have the course ID's as well as my proficiency in a language (None, Some, A Lot) housed within them (styling from Bootstrap)
    - Image - This was the image of myself in the top right, used it to make the project a little more personal
    - Link - I used the link tag in the head to get Bootstrap, Fonts, and my own CSS file into the project
