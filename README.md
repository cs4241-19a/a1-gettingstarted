## Technical Achievements
- **Sending over Image**: Server sends over jpg image of me, best I got ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### Design Achievements
- **Added a Style Sheet**: Shown in `style.css`. Not very advanced, but better than no css file at all.
- **Centered Page**: I gave the webpage a max width and set the margin to auto to make the page appear centered. I also added padding so the page elements wouldn't be too close to the edge of the div.
- **Added Various HTML Elements**: Added various lists and tables, including coloring the table's output to correspond with my experience level.
