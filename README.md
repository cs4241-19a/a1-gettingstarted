Assignment 1 - Hello World: Basic Deployment w/ Git, GitHub, Glitch
===

Assignment details
---

Do the following to complete this assignment:
3. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page, it displays correctly. You can do this locally by simply running `node server.js` from within the assignment directory.

4. Modify the README file according to the specification below.
5. Commit and push all your changes to GitHub. 
6. Deploy your project to Glitch. You can do this by [importing the repo from GitHub](https://medium.com/glitch/import-code-from-anywhere-83fb60ea4875)
7. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme (guide follows) so we can find it.
8. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo.

Naming and URL Scheme
---

You must use a consistent naming scheme for all projects in this course.
If we can't find it, we can't grade it.

By default Glitch often assigns your application a random name. To change it, click on the project dropdown menu in the upper left corner of Glitch. You will then see an additional text field displaying the project name in the resulting menu; click here to edit the name.

The name scheme should be `a1-yourGitHubUsername`.
The `a1` will need to be updated to `a2`, `a3`, and so on in future projects.
