## Technical Achievements
- **Implemented a CSS stylesheet**: I have never worked with node.js or CSS before so it 
                                    took a while to get those talking to each other.

### Design Achievements
- **Learned how to use CSS ids**: Shown in `style.css`, I gave multiple ul items ids in 
                                  order to give them different colored rectangles surrounding important information.
- **Learned how to use various HTML elements**: Learned how to add images, links, and lists to html webpages.
