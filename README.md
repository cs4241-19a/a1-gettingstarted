### Design Achievements
- Used a clean, simplistic design with refreshing color scheme to reprsent information about myself.
- Learned how to use css to change padding, position,color, size parameters and other specifications-especially for the layout of the page and for the format of buttons and the process bar. 
- Learned how to change the server.js file to implement the css file.
- Used a table to choose my course experience and chose bootstrap to help it look more visally appealing.
- Used ordered lists, underlined items, breaks, and different heading sizes to create titles and group text accordingly so that it is easier to read.
- Learned to implement a progress bar to represent prior knowledge of Webware that included shading, percentage, and a different progress colors.


###The Resources I Used:

1)w3schools.com was a great resource that helped me play around with the general format of the page. I was able to adapt elements, especially from this template page: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp. I however used the layouts to help me understand how grids were formatted and added more grids, deleted elements, and changed other specifications(color, font, etc...) to make it my own.

2)codeacademy was another great site and helped me gain an understanding of html and css:https://www.codecademy.com/pro/membership?gclid=Cj0KCQjw753rBRCVARIsANe3o47oig5r48EDbLoEf_2HybVmk3KZbQ-q6G-AnOr6ovkTpqpYaaDzOEcaAk-cEALw_wcB.

3)The bootstrap libraries on codepen and getbootstrap.com were another great resource since they helped me better represent and format the menu, the table, and the progress bar:https://codepen.io/natalia/pen/azdBNy and https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/
