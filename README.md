    A breif summary of the past few jobs I've had

## Technical Achievements
- **Converted standard Node JS server to Express JS server**: 
    Installed express using the node package manager, created dependency
- **Dynamically loaded html (for navbar)**
    Instead of copy and pasting hundreds of lines of html code to replicate nav bar on every page, I created a html file with the nav bar html and dynamically injected the code into any webpage.
- **Nodemon hot reloading**:
    Implemented an alternative script `start-dev` that allowed my server to automatically restart when changes occured to any JS file

### Design Achievements
- **Bootstrap CDN (content delivery network)**:
    Bootstrap allowed easy and quick site scaffolding and UI development. Allowed lots of features to easily
    be implemented. Using their content deliver network removed the need for any dependencies.
