This project shows all the basic information for me along with a picture and a song. Various design and technical decisions were made detailed in this readme.

Technical Achivments:

I added in a side navigation bar that will stay in the same place when the user scrolls through the page. I put in links to my GitHub and LinkedIn page.
I added in a song that he user can start pause, and download.
To make the index.html page cleaner I made my own style sheet and put all the CSS in that file.
Design Achivements:

The colors chosen in the table help correlate to my knowledge in the subject. Green is what I know best, yellow was for having basic knowledge, red is for never using the language before.
Along with choosing the various colors and fonts to add to the aesthetics of the page, I added in a table to view my experience with various programming languages and a picture.
