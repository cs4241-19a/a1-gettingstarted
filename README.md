This project shows a webpage that has basic information on me. I used the sample template and edited/formatted
it to include my information. I included the courses I have taken here at WPI, my experience with certain languages/technologies,
and the work/project experience I have had at WPi and outside of WPI.

I used the textbook as a resource for my code and previous knowledge from the HCI course.
Since I have some experience with HTML, this assignment was not very challenging for me, but I am looking forward to learning more on future assignments.
I did have trouble linking a style.css page to my index.html page. To work around this i just used the style tags in HTML.

## Technical Achievements

- I put style tags in the index.html file. I changed the font sizes of both of the headers and made them "bold-condensed".
  I also included an image at the top of the page that related to my major. I added a link on "computer science" that links to the computer science bachelors
  at WPI. I also linked the Oracle Health Sciences GBU to their homepage as well.

### Design Achievements

- I used Grandstander as the main text font of my site. I used the cursive Pacifico font as header fonts.
  Based on my adobe color wheel, I made the background color, header colors, text color, and link colors all different from one another.
  I have included the color wheel in the assets folder.
