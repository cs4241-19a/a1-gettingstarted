This project shows Information about Nicole Jutras (myself). 
I share an introduction, my majors, my CS classes taken, my programming 
experience, and my working experience. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I centered all the headings in my page by
adding "text-align:center" to my style. I also added "background-color:#FAE5FD"
in addition to my other colored fonts, this one not from the color palette
but still a suitable color. 

- **Experimented with other HTML tags**: I added a link with the 
a tag to my email address in the description. Additionally, I used 
the small tag to leave a little message at the bottom of my page. 
I italicized, with the i tag, the amounts of programming experience 
I had. I underlined, with the u tag, the two aspects of experience 
I have, Programming Experience and Working Experience. I also bolded, 
with the b tag, some key points in paragraphs I wrote. 


### Design Achievements
- **Used the Trebuchet MS Font from Google Fonts**: I used Trebuchet MS as the font 
for all the text in my site.
- **Created a color palette using color.adobe.com**: I used a color
palette I designed that is monochromatic. The screenshot of this palette 
can be found in the assets folder.
