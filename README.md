This project is an introduction to me and my background.

## Technical Achievements
- **Added Images**: Shown in index.html, I imported images in two different ways. In one instance I moved a local file into a resources folder to use and updated the server.js file to handle this. In the other instance I referenced an online image url.

### Design Achievements
- **Attempts at Bootstrap and Vaadin**: I spent a large amount of time experimenting and reading documentation for both bootstrap and vaadin frameworks. I was not able to incorporate any changes into my code. I need to do more research to understand where my problem lies.
