## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p, li, h1, h2, h3, and body selectors.
- **Simple JavaScript Animation**: Added a simple animation that changes color of some of the main header on the site.
- **Experimented with other HTML Tags**: Implemented and tried different options with the img, a, button, q, input, and div tags on the site.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Kufam, Kite One, and Yanone Kaffeesatz Fonts from Google Fonts**: I used Yanone Kaffeesatz as the font for h1 text, Kufam for the h2 text, and Kite One for the h3 text in my site.
- **Color Palette**: Created and used this adobe color palette throughout the website:
![Color Palette](ColorPalette.png?raw=true "Color Palette")

References: I mainly used www.w3schools.com for help with JavaScript and CSS rules and syntax.

Note to the TA: This assignment showed up late because I made the pull request from last year's git repository instead of this one. I spoke to professor Charles about this already and he said it was fine. Thank you!
