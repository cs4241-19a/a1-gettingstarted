This project shows a little bit about me more on the academic side.

There are sections listing the computer science course I have taken, my experiences with technologies and jobs, and a little something for fun.

## Technical Achievements
- **WebGL Library Implementation**: added necessary .js files and defined vertex shader and fragment shader.
- **Created a interactive drawing canvas**: Created an interactive canvas where the user can draw by creating points (through clicking) and the newest point will connect itself to the previous point to draw a line. The base code of this was taken from a previous project I have done in a Graphics course. I many modifications and added a couple features where the user can start a new polyline by pushing 'n' and change the color of the lines by pushing 'r', 'R', 'g', 'G', 'b', and 'B'.

### Design Achievements
- **Styling with CSS**: Shown in `style.css`, the page was styled from scrap with just CSS and no outside libraries. Added some color, did some formating of text. Sections are organized using a grid. 
- **Loaded an self portrait**: Shown in `index.html`, for more asthetic purposes
