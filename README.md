This project shows information about myself in a classic Star Wars fassion. This includes both academic and work experience,
as well as some information about myself. This Project was made within the glitch.com environment.

## Technical Achievements
--Added an ebedded YouTube video for playing the Star Wars opening music [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG5OsfOuEy0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG5OsfOuEy0).
If autoplay is not enabled, the music can be played by lcikcing the 'play' button at the top left.

--Due to the fact that once the project was assigned only the index.html file could be displayed, 
I altered the server code to display any kind of file that is incoming to the server. This was done
before the fixed example was shown in-class. 

### Design Achievements
--Added a Star Wars themed css file which was altered to be compatilble with the glitch.com environment.
--Credit for the Scrolling Text theme goes to Craig Buckler [http://www.sitepoint.com/css3-starwars-scrolling-text/](http://www.sitepoint.com/css3-starwars-scrolling-text/)
