This project represents a website containing information about my computer science-related experience both inside and outside the classroom. It was made using HTML and CSS, as well as with small additions made in JavaScript to the server.js file.

## Technical Achievements
- **Added the ability for the server to find the css style sheet.
- **Used basic HTML to add to the template and fill out the information for the website.

### Design Achievements
- **Added a css stylesheet (see stylesheet.css) in order to display a gradient background, colored text, a different font, larger text, and center-aligned text as well as altered the margins and padding for better viewing.
- **Bolded certain text inline to make the sections of the website more clear.
