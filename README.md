This project shows my first HTML/CSS/JS website! For assignment 1, 
I deployed a website using HTML and CSS with a server in Javascript to describe a little bit about myself, 
and my experience with different computer science topics. To view the information about me, hover over the circles, 
and watch them expand, and change color to reveal the information within.
## Technical Achievements
- **CSS organization and Classes** : I explored the use of classes for CSS. I discovered that an element could have more than one class so that the object can correspond to more than one CSS element. I used this fact to make each bubble part of the "circle" class, but also part of its own class. The purpose of this was so that I could organize the CSS to incorporate all similar attributes of the bubbles in .circle, but also create separate classes for each individual bubble to control characteristics like expanded size and color based on the content.
- **Expanding Bubbles**: As another technical achievement, I explored the use of transitions to create the expanding and contracting bubble effect. Having rarely used HTML or CSS, I struggled with creating smooth transitions of the size of the bubbles.  In addition, I moved the bubbles around so that they were not all centered on the page, and explored the use of margins to keep the bubbles from overlapping with each other.
- **Typewriter Heading**: As a technical achievement for the assignment, I used CSS in addition to the provided HTML. I made use of a typewriter graphic for the title/header. This technique was modified from https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/typewriter-effect/ to incorporate my color and font scheme, as well as repeat infinitely. In addition I modified the speed and movement of the blinker to go slower.


### Design Achievements
- **Color Scheme** : For a design achievement, I decided to use the color wheel methodically. Each bubble is initially a primary color. When expanded, the color becomes its opposite complementary color, for the most attractive contrast.  This choice is layered on a white background for simplicity.

- **Expanding Bubbles** : Rather than simply displaying the information on the screen, I decided to make the webpage interactive, by having the user hover over bubbles to reveal the information. This choice keeps the user interacting with the page, rather than just reading, as well as makes the screen less cluttered.  The bubbles are ordered strategically from most important to least important information.

- **Typewriter** : The typewriting font at the top was chosen to keep the website from looking very static. The motion draws the users eyes to the top where they can read the instructions about how to access the information about me.  This is something I had personally really liked from other websites I had seen, and was very interested in trying it on my own.
