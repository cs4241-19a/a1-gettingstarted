This project shows some information about me.

## Setup

## Technical Achievements

- **Added Bulma.io**: To help with styling of the website.
- **Added links to all of the tools and libraries I use**: To provide a direct link if the reader is interested.

### Design Achievements

- **Used Bulma.io**: To help aid in the design of the website, making it easier for me to make it pretty.
- **Used progress bars**: To help show level of expertise and knowledge of programming languages, tools, and platforms.
- **Used breadcrumbs**: To show what CS classes I took at WPI, in the order that I took them.
- **Added footer**: Giving credit of the website to me, as well as explaining the lack of CS classes due to me changing my major.
- **Added stripes to the table**: Added stripes to the table so they're easier to differentiate line to line.
