# Assignment 1- Alex Simoneau

This project shows a basic HTML/CSS webpage with information about me written on it. It's animated with keyframes and has a color palette from [color.adobe.com](color.adobe.com).

## Technical Achievements

**CSS Styling**
: This page is styled with CSS and has rules for 6 tags in 5 different statements. The rules for the table and td are combined in the same statement.

**Animation**
: This page is not animated with JS but it is animated with CSS keyframes. Using margins and animation delays I created a "schwoop-in" animation (see the last part of style.css).

**Different Tags**
: This page uses divs, description lists, tables, horizontal rules and linking to expand on the tags we learned in lecture. Using [w3schools.com](w3schools.com) I was able to play around with other tags and experiment with different designs.

## Design Achievements

**Color palette**
: Using a color palette from [color.adobe.com](color.adobe.com) (see screenshot in repo) I created a monochromatic pastel purple theme.

**Google Fonts Linking**
: I chose a Montserrat font from [fonts.google.com](fonts.google.com) to style the page to be more asthetically pleasing instead of using a default font.
