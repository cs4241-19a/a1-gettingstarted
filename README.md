## Technical Achievements
- **Utilized many different HTML tags**: 5 of these tags include
    - the unordered list (ul) tag to list the classes i have taken. 
    - the ordered list (ol) tag to list the order of comfort of the different concepts
    - marquee tag to say hello to the user in a different and interesting way
    - span tag to apply a style (in this case a text color) to a singular word in a paragraph
    - "a" tag to give a convenient link to a very popular webside (for convienence)
    - "div" tag to represent the circle in the javascript animation
- **Animated an element using Javascript** I utilized the interval funtionality of javascript to animated a cirle bouncing back and forth. Additional functionality includes the ability to stop and start the circle's movement by clicking on the circle itself. You gotta be quick!
- **Created a circle from a div element using style modifiers** I untilized 5 different style modifiers to create a circle.
    - Width and height to specify how large the circle should be
    - position absolute to be able to manipulate the pixel values of its position
    - background to specify the color to be red so that it stands out from the rest of the page
    - border-radius 50% to curve the edges of the shape to make the element appear as a circle


### Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
