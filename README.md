## Technical Achievements
- I used jQuery.js to create a navigation bar that is transparent on the home page but shifts color when scrolled down, also created typewriter effect in the education section. 
Used an available javascript file online and edited the css file to include a cursor and make it fir the rest of the theme. 
- Edited server code to create response and requests for css, javascript and image files used in the code

### Design Achievements
- No templates/external css files were used for this project
- Created all the elements from scratch
- Created a navigation bar that links to each section and is transparent at the bottom of the page but sticks to the top and becomes white when scrolled enough. 
Also created all the highlights and hover settings
- created home page typewriter effect and used it to edit the typewriter effect in the education section that runs in a loop
- Added tables and lists with unique designs built from scratch
- Added hover effect on each section, with hover effects on individual elements like the #wpi2020 pic and the experience list
- Worked hard to ensure all the spacing and margins are good
- Added numerous small elements like the salmon colored text for salmon, orange text course list, changes (in a way inversion) in colors for the navbar when on home and when
stuck to the top
