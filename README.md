This project shows my basic understanding of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. Using the 3 languages, I created a simple webpage which contains information about my courses at WPI, my experience with different coding languages/methods, and my work experience. Listed below are my technical and design achievements for this project. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p, li, and a selectors...
1. Styled the page using CSS
  - Added style to h1. Set its color to be dimgrey, set its font family to Bebas Neue (A Google font), and set its font size to be 70px.
  - Added style to the ul. For styling purposes I added a box around it with a background of powder blue. Also added a padding of 50px to the list. Lastly, assigned it to be in the Assistant font family (A Google font).
  - Added style to h2. Set the border to be solid 2px and powderblue in color. Set its font family to be Bebas Neue (A Google font).

2. Added a simple JavaScript animation
  - With the help of the tutorials on W3Schools, I was able to create a simple JavaScript for my heading where individual letters get placed in order. The code is placed under the "script" tag in the index.html file.
  

### Design Achievements
