# A1-REPIMENTEL

app: https://a1-repimentel.glitch.me/

## Description

This project shows some my html and css skills, really tried to make it as simple and good looking as possible, some of the animations were adapted from existing ones, and took a little to figure out how to properly use them, also worked on getting the server to load multiple files before we saw it in class

## Technical Achievements

CSS Styling

Achieved a nice layout and incorporated css animations to the project, some of them were a little difficult to make not disruptive. (animation on programming experience part was a little challenging)
