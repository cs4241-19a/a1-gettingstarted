This project shows a sample html website showing a picture of myself, an about me section (with my major), related coursework, work experience, programming experience,
and a link to my github. 

Note: I needed to make some small modifications of where images are found on glitch (needed to add images to assets and reference them from there)

## Technical Achievements
- **Javascript Hyperlink**: Used javascript to create a hyperlink loaded behind a github image

### Design Achievements
- **Bulma Design**: Used the Bulma framework to overhaul the entire look of the website to make it look more professional and clean.
