For some reason, glitch doesn't want to use my latest code and keeps rewinding back to the original template. I made sure I imported from Github correctly because my README can be found on glitch. But the half of the stylings are just completely gone. I don't think there is anything wrong with my code because it can be opend up fine on 1) my localhost 2) directly opened as a HTML file 3) with Webstorm. 

Design Achievement:
- Self-picked every single color used in this
- Most elements are animated


Technical Achievement:
- Learned how to use multiple JQuery/JS/Angular/CSS libraries including: animate on scroll, scroll reveal, animate.css, particles.js and typeit. Particularly, learned how to use particle.js as background but only for the main page. 
- Modified an animated staggering bar chart (original here: https://codepen.io/vajkri/pen/NxzZwL)
- Modified most elements of the template (the original template can be found here for comparison: https://startbootstrap.com/previews/resume/)
