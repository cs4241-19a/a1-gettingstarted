This project shows that I created a starting web site containing some information about myself such as my major and my experiences and deployed it onto Glitch. 

### Design Achievements
- **Configued Bootstrap**: Used bootstrap to create a navigation bar to be able to click on separate pages and divide the information.
- **Used CSS style sheets**: Shown in `style.css`, the code adds specific designs to the content.
- **Added extra content**: Added lots of extra content to the overall website and designed it in a way that looks clean and presentable.
