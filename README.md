This project shows information about me, including my schedule, my linkedin page, my previous experience and classes I took before.

## Technical Achievements
 Embedded video:I learned how to insert a youtube video to a html file
 Implement jqurey: I used jquery for "toggle to show more class I took"
 Insert a picture & an external link: I learned how to insert a picture and an external link to my linked in page
### Design Achievements
 Added table for my schedule: I learned how to insert table into html file and I think it is the most clear way to show my schedule
 Better toggle point: I learned to make the font size bigger when hover over the toggle point (which is "Toggle for more classes I took") and I also made it red to stand out more.
